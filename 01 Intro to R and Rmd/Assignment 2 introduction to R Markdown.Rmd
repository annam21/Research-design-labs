## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
head(cars)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Try it now!

## Assignment 

1. In the header, change the name of the author to your name and update the date to today's date. 

2. Load your penguin data (tip: use `here()` to help navigate to the right file)
```{r}

```

3. Display the first 6 lines of your data using the function `head()`
```{r}

```

4. Display the first 3 lines of your data, using an optional argument in the function `head()`
```{r}

```

5. How many columns are in the penguin data? Explain how you found that number and include code that helped you.
```{r}

```

6. Run spell check on this document (`Edit > Check Spelling`), then render this document using the **Knit** button. Email the resulting HTML file to paul.lukacs@umontana.edu
