# Research question
 - lm: researcher's Q was: what is the relationship between x and y?


# Object-oriented programming 
- Everything in R is an *object* 
- Every object has a *class* 
- The class of an object determines how code behaves on that object 

For example: `plot()` is an object with the class *function*. Functions do an action and create an output (in this case, a plot) when you put something inside the parentheses. If you run `plot()` on categorical data (class: factor), it will create a boxplot. If you run it on continuous data (class: numeric), it will create a scatterplot.
