# Getting started 

We will be using functions from the `tidyverse` suite of packages, which are designed for data manipulation. `tidyverse` is an *umbrella package* or a package of packages. When you install it, you will see on the console all the packages it contains as it downloads. 

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

To use the package 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

# Read in data 
```{r}
penguin <- read_csv(here("data/penguins_raw.csv"))
```

# Wide vs. long data 
```{r}

```

# Save your output 
write_csv()

# Glossary 

- long data: data set up where each row contains one observation 
- tidyverse: an R package that is built for data manipulation
- wide data: data set up where columns contain multiple observations
