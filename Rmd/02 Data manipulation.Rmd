# Wide vs. long data 

### What are long data? 

In long data: 

- Each variable forms a column 
- Each observation forms a row

```{r, echo = F}
t <- tibble::tibble(
  plot = c(1,1,2,2),
  treatment = c("A", "B", "A", "B"),
  abundance = c(12, 15, 20, 21)
)
kable(t, align = "l",
      # caption = "Long data"
      )  %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

### What are wide data? 

Wide data show observations in columns. 

Here is one way to show the data in wide format

```{r, echo = F}
t %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = treatment, values_from = abundance, names_prefix = "treatment_") %>%
  # knitr::kable(format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
  knitr::kable(align = "l", 
               # caption = "Wide data, version 1"
               ) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left") 

```

Here is a second way to show the same data in wide format 

```{r, echo = F}
t %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = plot, values_from = abundance) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = "l", 
               # caption = "Wide data, version 2"
               ) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Plot" = 2))
```

### Why use long data? 

- There are many ways to display or organize wide data, but only one way to display long data 
- R functions work on columns. It is far simpler to arrange, subset, or summarize data in a column than across columns. This is because R functions only work on data of the same class. All entries in a column have the same class whereas different columns can have different classes. 

# Clean data

Clean data have the following properties: 

- contain only column names and data (no graphs, no color-coding)
- no duplicate or irrelevant observations 
- everything that should be grouped together is entered in *exactly* the same way 
  - R is case-sensitive and space-sensitive so `"Male"`, `"male"`, `"male "`, and `"M"` will all be treated as different values 
- column names should not have spaces or special characters 
- each column should be the correct class 
  - e.g., Dates should be treated as dates, not as characters. 
- missing data are identified and potentially removed
  - missing data should be entered as `NA`, which has special meaning in R. Notice, it has no quotes and is not a character (`"NA"` or `"N/A"` or `"Not applicable"`)
- No errors from data entry 

# Getting started 

As a reminder, packages are sets of functions that you can download and use in R. You download the package once to your computer using `install.packages("package-name")` and you can use the functions in R by calling `library("package-name")` at the beginning of your R session. 

We will be using functions from the **`tidyverse`** suite of packages, which are designed for data manipulation. **`tidyverse`** is an *umbrella package* or a package of packages. When you install it, it will print out all the packages it contains on the console. 

One of the most used packages in **`tidyverse`** is **`dplyr`**. We will talk about a lot of commands from that package. 

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Packages we will use
```{r, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

# Read in data 

The first **`tidyverse`** function we will use is `read_csv()`. This serves the same basic purpose of `read.csv()`, but it fixes some issues and undesirable features of that function. From now on, we will use `read_csv` for loading data. 

```{r}
penguin <- read_csv(here("data/penguins_clean.csv"))
```

### Preview the data 
```{r, eval = F}
head(penguin)
str(penguin)
```

# Selecting, removing, and rearranging *columns* 

The function `select()` works on *columns*. The first argument to this function and all dplyr functions is the data frame you're working on. The rest of the arguments in `select()` are the names of the columns you want to retain, in the order you want to show them. 

```{r}
select(penguin, individualID, Species, Stage)
```

Notice that column names are **NOT** put in quotation marks `" "` when using `select()`. This is one of the advantages of dplyr -- it makes typing faster. 

To select all columns *except* certain ones, you can subtract those columns 
```{r}
select(penguin, -studyName, -Comments)
```

Note: you cannot combine subtracting columns with positively selecting columns. You must do all of one or the other. 

# Selecting and removing *rows* 

The function `filter()` works on *rows*. As with `select()`, the first argument of `filter()` is the name of the data you're working with. The subsequent arguments are the Boolean (logical) conditions that must be met to *keep* any given row. 
```{r}
filter(penguin, culmen_depth_mm < 15)
```
This code only *keeps* observations of individuals that have a culmen depth of less than 15 mm. 

### Boolean operators (aka logical operators)
```{r, echo = F}

b <- tibble::tibble(
  Operator = c("<", "<=", ">", ">=", "==", "!=", "|", "&"), 
  Description = c("less than", "less than or equal to", "greater than", "greater than or equal to", "exactly equal to", "not equal to", "or", "and") 
)
kable(b, caption = "Boolean operators") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
``` 

# Adding new columns 

To add a new column, use `mutate()`. Like other **`dplyr`** functions, the first argument is the name of the data you're working with. The structure of each argument after that is 

`<new-column-name> = <value>`

```{r}
tmp <- select(penguin, individualID, culmen_length_mm)
mutate(tmp, 
       treatment = "Control", 
       culmen_length_m = culmen_length_mm/1000,
       culmen_length_ft = culmen_length_m * 3.281)
```

Mutate can create columns with entirely new values (like the `treatment` column) or calculate values based on preexisting columns (like `culmen_length_m`). You can even use columns you've just created (like `culmen_length_ft`). 

# Stringing together **`dplyr`** commands

What if we want to both select columns and filter rows? 

**`dplyr`** and the **`tidyverse`** in general offer a solution to doing multiple commands without creating intermediate objects. It's called the *pipe*, which looks like this `%>%`

The pipe goes after a **`dplyr`** function, and it tells R to keep looking for another function to do next. The pipe tells R to move data forward through a sequence of functions. When using `%>%`, you will not need to fill in the data argument of **`dplyr`** functions.

When using `%>%`, try to organize your code vertically by going to a new line after each `%>%`.

```{r}
penguin %>% 
  filter(Species == "Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)") %>%
  select(individualID, date_egg, Sex) 
```

Notice that R executes each line in order, so switching the functions will not always work.

```{r, eval = F}
penguin %>% 
  select(individualID, date_egg, Sex) %>% 
  filter(Species == "Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)") 
  
```

# Summarizing data 

**`dplyr`** offers a way to very quickly organize and summarize data through the combination of functions `group_by()` and `summarize()`. The two are most frequently used together. 

For `group_by()` the arguments are the names of the columns you want to use as grouping variables. 

For `summarize()`, the structure of each argument is:

`<new-variable-name> = some-function(<existing-variable-name>)`

```{r}
penguin %>% 
  group_by(Species, Sex) %>% 
  summarize(mn_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
```

# Saving your clean data

If you are working with raw data and write an R script to make it clean and tidy, you can save the clean data as a CSV. To do so you will need to 

1. Assign your clean data as an object
2. Use `write_csv()` to save a CSV file. 

For example: 
```{r, eval = F}
peng2 <- penguin %>% 
  group_by(Species, Sex) %>% 
  summarize(mn_mass = mean(body_mass_g))

write_csv(peng2, "data/penguin_summary.csv")
```


# Advanced data manipulation 

# Handling NAs

Missing data should be recorded in R as `NA`, which has special meaning in R. Let's add an `NA` to our data so we can work with it. 

```{r}
penguin2 <- penguin
penguin2[2, 2] <- NA
head(penguin2)
```

To find NAs in the data, you will not be able to use this code: 
```{r, eval = F}
penguin2 %>% 
  filter(sample_number == NA)
```

Instead, you will need to use the function `is.na()`.

```{r}
penguin2 %>% 
  filter(is.na(sample_number))
```

You can find values that are anything other than `NA` using `!is.na()`
```{r}
penguin2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(sample_number))
```

There are always special functions to find `NA`s. Another useful one is `drop_na()`, which will remove all rows that have an `NA` in any column. 

If any value in the column is `NA`, R will not know how to compute summary functions (like `mean()`), so the answer will be `NA`. Therefore, many summary functions have an optional `na.rm = T`. Compare the output between these two lines of code

```{r}
penguin2 %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(mn_sample_num = mean(sample_number))
penguin2 %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(mn_sample_num = mean(sample_number, na.rm = T))
```
# Renaming columns

To rename columns, use the function `rename()`. The syntax of the arguments is 

`<new-column-name> = <old-column-name>`

```{r}
penguin %>% 
  rename(styNm = studyName)
```

# Reshaping long and wide data 

You can transform wide data to long format and vice versa using the functions `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` from the **`tidyr`** package (part of the **`tidyverse`** suite of packages.)

To go from long to wide data, you will use `pivot_wider()`. This function requires the arguments `names_from` (the name of the column in your long data set whose values will each become column names in the wide data set) and `values_from` (the name of the column in your long data whose values will fill in the values of your new columns in your wide data set)

![](../misc/pivot_wider image.jpg)

To go from wide data to long data, you will use `pivot_longer()`. The first argument does not have a counterpart in `pivot_wider()`. You will need to specify exactly which columns will be involved in the pivot and which should be left alone. 

`pivot_longer()` additionally requires arguments that are similar to those from `pivot_wider()`. `names_to` will be the name of the new column you will create from the column names in your wide data and `values_to` will be the name of the new column you will create containing the values in your current wide data.
