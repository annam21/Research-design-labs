# What is ggplot2?

**`ggplot2`** is a package built for visualizing data and results. **`ggplot2`** works somewhat uniquely in that each component of the plot is an element (or layer) that you add, rather than being an argument in a function. 

`ggplot` is both a function in **`ggplot2`** and its output (a ggplot)

**`ggplot2`** is in the **`tidyverse`** suite of packages. Since we will also be using dplyr functions, we will load the **`tidyverse`** in its entirety. 
```{r, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

**`ggplot2`** works best with data in long format. 

To build a ggplot, we will use the following structure: 
```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(data = <DATA>,
       mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>) ) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

There are 3 critical things to fill in: 

1. `<DATA>` The name of your data, which is in long format
2. `<MAPPINGS>` "aesthetic mappings" inside the `aes()` function. 
    a. These are columns of your data that will be displayed on the plot in some way
    b. **Note** `aes()` is a function *within* the `ggplot()` function. 
3. `<GEOM_FUNCTION>` what type of plot you want to build. This is a function beginning with `geom_` such as `geom_boxplot()`, `geom_point()`, or `geom_histogram()`. 
    a. See the full list [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layers) 

**`ggplot`** code looks unique because it uses `+` at the end of each line. The `+` is related to `%>%` but not exactly the same because the order of elements rarely matters. 

# Building a ggplot scatter plot
```{r, message = F}
penguin <- read_csv(here("data/penguins_clean.csv"))
```
To build a scatter plot, we will use the following: 

- `<DATA>` penguin
- `<MAPPINGS>` the column names in penguin that will serve as the independent (x) and dependent (y) variables
- `<GEOM_FUNCTION>` geom_point() for a scatter plot 

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguin,
       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
```

If we want to change something about all the points at once, we can add it as an argument in `geom_point()`. See all possible arguments on the ggplot2 Cheat Sheet. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguin,
       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = "blue")
```
Alternatively, to change how the points display based on another variable in the data, add it to `aes()` instead of `geom_point()`
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguin,
       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = Species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

# Changing elements of a ggplot

Things that apply to the way the plot *itself* looks, not how the data are visualized, are considered additional elements that you add to the plot. Examples include (but are not limited to!):

- changing axis labels
- changing the background 
- changing the axis scale
- adding a title 

To change the background, we can add a theme 
```{r, message = F}
ggplot(data = penguin,
       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_classic()
```

To change the axis labels, we can continue to add on 
```{r, message = F}
ggplot(data = penguin,
       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_classic() + 
  xlab("Body mass (g)") + 
  ylab("Flipper length (mm)")
```

# Building different types of plots 

### A boxplot 

To build a boxplot instead of a scatter plot, we change the `<GEOM_FUNCTION>` from `geom_point()` to `geom_boxplot()`

```{r, message = F}
ggplot(data = penguin,
       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = Species)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Histogram

To build a histogram, we use `geom_histogram()` and only specify the x column in `aes()`. 
```{r, message = F}
ggplot(data = penguin,
       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
