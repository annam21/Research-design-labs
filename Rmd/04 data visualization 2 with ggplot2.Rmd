# Learning objectives
- Add additional layers to a single plot
- Display confidence intervals on a scatter plot
- Visualize a distribution with a density plot
- Create multiple plots in one panel using facets

# Adding layers

Whenever you want to add more things to a graph, use `+`. For example, let's add a regression line for each group. 
```{r, message = F}
ggplot(data = penguin,
       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Notice that because we included `Species` in the `aes()` mappings, ggplot automatically builds one regression line for each group and it applies the appropriate color.
